### What I learned

This project has allowed me to read back through my JS ES6 notes i have made throughout some online courses and allowed me to put into practice the knowledge. I have been able to achieve with no doubt lots of improvement opportunities the use of Variables, If Statements and Logic to provide styling depending on the entry from the user. 

### Continued development

I will continue to develop my skills to get out of IF Hell! There is a lot of it in my solution. I will refine my code once I have been able to cover more topics and come back to address the logic that will remove the class '.error' when the function is called again unless the argument is still true and the error class is still required.

Developing a more in-depth awareness of input elements and UI / UX will allow me to style these responsively so they seamlessly adapt screen sizes.
